# Machine-Learning-Wave-Chaotic-System-Classification

This repository stores the RNN code for the ML-based classification of the transmission measurement data of wave chaotic systems.

The Python code forms up the core of this study, i.e. the realization of the RNN with TenserFlow.

The Matlab code mainly pre-processes the raw measurement data.
